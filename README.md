HTTPS

Practice to clone repo using HTTPS

From my Tntra gmail and username

I tried cloning the repo using HTTPS

I deleted the existing Personal Access Token (PAT)

Also I created a new one and saved it. I want to see why it didnt ask me to enter the token when I was working on this repo.


SSH

I am practicing to clone using SSH keys.

I have generated SSH keys using this command:
        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

After this command I opened Github and in Settings>SSH & GPG keys> Created New SSH KEY> Copied the public SSH key there.
